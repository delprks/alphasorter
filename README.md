### Overview

AlphaSort is a library for sorting strings according to user-defined rules.

It currently supports natural sorting of strings, as well as limited support
for non-English languages.

### Examples

```
scala> TBA
```

### Getting AlphaSort

TBA

```scala
resolvers += TBA

libraryDependencies += TBA
```

### Known Issues

    1. It does not yet support non-English characters completely.
    2. Dictionary injection has not been implemented yet.

### Future Work

Fix the above issues.
